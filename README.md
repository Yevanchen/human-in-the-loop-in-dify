### Description

[User Guide](https://local-carp-52a.notion.site/gotohuman-1704490152f08087be79c90f1fdde2ed?pvs=4)

A community implementation of human-in-the-loop functionality using [GoToHuman](https://www.gotohuman.com/), enabling asynchronous review capabilities. When AI workflows contain unstable outputs, the GoToHuman tool can create rich review interfaces for any output variables from Dify workflow nodes.

Key features:
- Create customizable review pages with various frontend components
- Comprehensive review management backend
- Automatic review task creation when workflow reaches designated nodes
- Asynchronous human review process with edit, approve, and reject actions
- Webhook callbacks to endpoints when review status changes
- Ability to trigger reverse calls to other Dify apps from the endpoint


Flow:
1. Workflow reaches a GoToHuman node
2. Variables are sent to GoToHuman to create a review task
3. Human reviewers can asynchronously:
   - View the data in a customized interface
   - Edit values if needed
   - Approve or reject the review
4. On status update, GoToHuman sends a webhook to the endpoint
5. Endpoint processes the review result and can trigger another Dify app workflow

This enables quality control and human oversight at any point in your AI workflows while maintaining asynchronous operation.
